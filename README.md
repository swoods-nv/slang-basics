# slang-basics

This repository contains some very bare-bones examples of how to use the Slang runtime compilation API, and how to use generics and interfaces in a simple compute shader, and invoke it using SlangPy. It's mostly intended as fodder for live demonstrations, but please feel welcome to use it as you need.
